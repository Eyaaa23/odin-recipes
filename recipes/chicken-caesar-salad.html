    <p>This crispy chicken Caesar salad is loaded with herbs and happiness! The crouton crust on the chicken really boosts the flavor. You could also add tomato, onion or any topping you'd put on a salad.</p>

    <ul>
        <li>2 cups Caesar salad croutons, divided.</li>
        <li>1 pound ground chicken.</li>

    <h2 class="page p2">Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely crush 1 cup croutons and place in a shallow bowl. In a large bowl, gently combine chicken, salt and pepper. With wet hands, shape chicken mixture into four 5-in. patties. Coat both sides with crouton crumbs.</li>
