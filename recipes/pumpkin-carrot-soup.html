        <p>This soup's silky-smooth texture is also fantastic for little ones whether you're doing purees or baby led weaning. And serving it with dunkable sides like mini naan and veggies is a fun way to encourage toddlers to give it try.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 210°C. Line a large roasting pan with non-stick baking paper. Place pumpkin and carrot in lined pan. Drizzle over 2 tablespoons of oil and toss to coat. Roast for 30-35 minutes or until golden and tender.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion. Season with salt. Reduce heat to low. Cook, stirring often, for 20 minutes or until soft. Add garlic, mustard seeds, coriander, cumin, turmeric, cardamom and chilli powder, if desired. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes or until aromatic and the mustard seeds start to pop.</li>
            <li>Add the pumpkin, carrot, stock and water. Increase heat to medium. Cover and bring to the boil. Reduce heat to low. Cook, covered, for 15 minutes. Uncover. Set aside for 15 minutes to cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Transfer half the pumpkin mixture to the jug of a blender. Blend until smooth. Transfer the soup to a clean saucepan. Repeat with remaining pumpkin mixture. </li>
            <li>Place over low heat and cook, stirring, for 4 minutes or until heated through. Ladle among serving bowls. Top with a dollop of yoghurt and stir to create a swirled effect. Serve with naan bread.</li>
