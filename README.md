# odin-recipes

This is my 1st TOP ([The odin project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)) project, it is intended to be a practice project for basic HTML. It's a simple website that contains a homepage that link to other pages that contain my personal favorite recipes.

In this project, I got to use most if not all the basic HTML elements I learned so far to make this website, like: html, head, body, p, title, meta, H1 to H6 (only needed 2 types of headers tho), img, a, ul, ol and so on, with also some of their designed attributes.
